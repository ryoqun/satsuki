  satsuki - StATefUl KIboard

version:
  0.0.1

description:
  satsuki extends the traditional keyboard state model, which only recognizes
  a few key combinations (i.e. Ctrl+<key>, Alt+<key>).

  By extended keyboard state, you can type hard-to-type letters (punctuations,
  numbers, uppercase letters, etc) with more ease (YMMV).

  This works as an ibus IME engine. As such, when enabled, satsuki intercepts
  all input key events. Then, according to its mode changed by certain key
  events, it sends translated key events to ibus-supported applications.

  Space+j => "{"
  Space+k => "}"
  ...

  Henkan+<lowercase letter key> => <UPPERCASE LETTER>

  Henken+q => "1"
  Henken+w => "2"
  ...

  Muhenkan+j => down arrow key equivalent
  Muhenkan+k => up arrow key equivalent

  z+<any key> or /+<any key> => Ctrl+<any key> equivalent

  That's all, you can live only with home position and neighboring keys for the
  rest of your life.

working platform(s):
  Ubuntu with python-ibus package installed and with the following patch applied

  https://github.com/ryoqun/ibus/commit/d059132885d3c90647f0

prepare to use:
  1. apply above patch
  2. restart ibus-daemon

try:
  $ make test

install:
  $ sudo make install

bugs:
  - not written in Ruby
  - no test
  - can't work with Qt based applications (ibus bug?)
  - no documentation
  - can't chain with other ibus engines (ibus limitation)

not bugs:
  - its name (including its case usage and origin of the second 's')
